      "summary": "Pipefy.com shows steady but secondary visibility across top LLMs in the workflow automation and process management space. The brand often appears in mid-list positions and is received with moderately positive sentiment, highlighting its flexibility and ease of use. However, compared to larger competitors like Asana and Monday.com, Pipefy has a smaller share of voice and is rarely featured first for generic team collaboration queries. There is continued opportunity to improve LLM positioning through more direct content targeting and examples, especially in collaborative and enterprise automation use cases.",
